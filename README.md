# C Vec
A very simple and stupid C Vector library i have written some time ago.

The library implements a very very simple Vector which automatically grows when pushin.
Using the typeof operator or using less functions this could be made ergonomic but this should
just be normal C99.

Take a look at the examples directory for some examples.
